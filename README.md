An Ultralite ORM layer on top of SQLite database for iOS.

New projects should pull in the Ultralite and FMDB directories into their projects.

For an example of how to use Ultralite take a look in QuizAppDelegate.

UltraliteDB is currently being used in the following real world apps.

Breakthrough Stats - Basketball Stats & Scoring

Real documentation coming soon...

Ultralite is built on top of FMDB 
https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb

For now you can just extract out the files UltraliteDB.h and UltraliteDB.m for new projects.

A big thank you to Breakthrough Basketball, LLC who made this project possible!
